# Language Models Utilities

*Last updated: 19/09/2025*

**Goal:** Collect and share guidance + code snippets for running LM-related tasks.

This repo was originally put together for my colleagues at [Business AI Lab](https://www.facebook.com/business.ai.lab), but I‚Äôd love to hear feedback or ideas from anyone who finds it useful!

## Existing utilities

* Simple LLM call

## Planned utilities

* LLM voting mechanisms

‚ö†Ô∏è **Reminder:** A lot of example code floating around the internet uses older versions of the OpenAI Python package. Double-check the latest changes before copying anything into production.
